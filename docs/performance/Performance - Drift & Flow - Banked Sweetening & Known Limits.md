# Performance — Drift & Flow — Banked Sweetening & Known Limits

## Banked sweetening (non-blocking polish)
- Refine typography scale and spacing on deliverable/job rows for even tighter scan.
- Replace prompt-based actions in Capacity with the shared modal UX.
- Add microcopy for Flow Meter drilldown priority to improve explainability.
- Subtle skeleton/empty states on lists instead of plain text placeholders.
- Harmonize iconography (e.g., a consistent “drift” glyph on chips).

## Known limits (prototype constraints)
- Mock data only; no backend/APIs; persistence is localStorage override.
- Capacity math simplified to remainingHours/est-assigned minus actual; no velocity modeling.
- Change orders are simple records without status workflow.
- Reports are static and not filtered by the performance filters.
- Accessibility is basic; keyboard focus is present on core controls but not fully audited.

## Postponed items
- Rich evidence overlays (time entries, service type charts) are placeholders.
- No export/print mode for reports or performance surfaces.
- No multi-user/state sync; reviewed/confidence are local to the browser.
