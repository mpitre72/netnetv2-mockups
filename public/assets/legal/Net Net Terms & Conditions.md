***LAST UPDATED: May 30, 2025***

Layman's Introduction

Hi there\! From everyone who has worked tirelessly on developing Net Net, we thank you for considering our Software as a Service (SaaS) platform. Like you, we’re not big fans of all this legalese and what feels like a lot of mumbo jumbo nonsense when someone without a juris doctorate reads them. Why the heck do we need all this stuff, right?

Well, those same lawyers tell us we have to have them to make sure we’re all on the same page and what we’re sure is far more important to them… show them the money. Since we’re just a bunch of business savvy nerds who want to build great software for our customers, we relented, sold off our children’s college funds and hired them.

So without further ado and to make sure those poor lawyerly souls have more yachts to water ski behind, let’s get started.

⚠️ **Important Notice on Sensitive Data**

Net Net is not designed to process or store sensitive personal information such as Social Security numbers, financial account details, health records, or any data subject to specialized regulation (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, FISMA). You agree not to upload such data. Doing so violates these Terms and may result in account suspension or termination. Net Net disclaims all liability for any consequences resulting from such misuse.

# **1\. Agreement to Terms**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") form a binding agreement between Net Net, LLC ("Net Net," "we," "us," or "our") and you, the person or entity accessing the Net Net website, applications, or related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.

## **1.1 Changes to Terms**

We may update or modify these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you by email, in-app message, or other reasonable means. Continued use of the Service after any changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service.("Terms") form a binding agreement between Net Net, LLC ("Net Net," "we," "us," or "our") and you, the person or entity accessing the Net Net website, applications, or related services (collectively, the "Service"). By using the Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Service.

# **2\. Eligibility & Scope**

## **2.1 Age**

You must be at least 18 years old and able to form a legally binding contract.

## **2.2 Compliance**

You may use the Service only in compliance with applicable laws. The Service is **not** designed to comply with industry-specific requirements such as HIPAA, FISMA, or GLBA.

## **2.3 International Use**

If you access the Service from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for local compliance.

## **2.4 International Users (EU/EEA):**

Net Net does not market to or intend for the Service to be used by individuals located in the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). If you are located in the EU or EEA, you are **not authorized to use the Service** unless we have separately agreed in writing to provide GDPR-compliant data processing under a valid Data Processing Agreement. By accessing and using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are not located in the EU or EEA unless such agreement has been made.

# **3\. Account Registration & Security**

## **3.1 Registration Obligations**

You may need to create an account. You agree to:

1. Provide accurate and complete registration information and keep it current.

2. Maintain the confidentiality of your login credentials and be responsible for all activities under your account.

3. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or security breach. We may reclaim or change any username we deem inappropriate.

# **4\. Intended Use & Acceptable Use Policy**

## **4.1 Purpose**

Net Net is designed to manage individual Jobs—projects or retainers—on a one‑Job‑per‑client or one‑Job‑per‑engagement basis. Quick Tasks are intended only for small ad‑hoc actions that are not part of a larger Job.

## **4.2 Prohibited Workarounds**

Activities that violate this Intended Use include, without limitation:

* Job bundling: consolidating multiple unrelated client engagements or internal initiatives into a single Job to reduce subscription fees.  
* Excessive use of Quick Tasks: running ongoing or substantial work through Quick Tasks that would ordinarily require a Job.  
* Any other configuration that Net Net reasonably determines is an attempt to circumvent the pricing model.

## **4.3 Monitoring**

Net Net may monitor account usage for compliance.

## **4.4 Remedies**

If Net Net determines, in its sole discretion, that your usage violates this policy, we may: (a) require you to restructure Jobs or upgrade your subscription tier; (b) restrict or suspend access to specific features; or (c) terminate your subscription with or without notice under Section 11\.

## **4.5 No Waiver**

Failure to enforce this policy once does not waive future enforcement.

## **4.6 Acceptable Use Policy**

### **4.6.1 Purpose:**

This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") outlines the rules and limitations that apply to your use of the Service. The goal is to ensure the Service is used responsibly, legally, and without risk to Net Net or others.

### **4.6.2 Prohibited Uses:**

You may not use the Service to:

* Violate any applicable law, regulation, or third-party right.  
* Upload, transmit, or store any content that is unlawful, harmful, or infringing.  
* Access the Service using automated scripts, bots, or scraping tools.  
* Interfere with or disrupt the performance, security, or integrity of the Service.  
* Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts or Net Net’s systems.  
* Store or process any sensitive data including health records, Social Security numbers, financial account details, or similar data subject to specialized regulation (e.g., HIPAA, GLBA, FISMA), unless otherwise agreed in writing.

Net Net reserves the right to investigate violations of this AUP and take appropriate action, including but not limited to removing content, suspending accounts, disabling access, or reporting unlawful behavior to the authorities.
